# Getting ready for the final

* When: Final Day
* Where: In class

You will be giving a brief presentation (less than 2 minutes + questions) about what you've done this semester. For those of you that worked on multiple projects, this means you'll probably only have time to focus on one.

Unless you have a laptop you can attach to the projector, you should make a YouTube video about what you've done. For your presentation, you should explain to us what you did, what was hard, what you learned, etc. Please do not have narration on the video.

I will grade you based on the following:

* Presentation: Was it practiced, professional, and under 2 minutes?
* Work: Did you put in the time required this semester?
* Understanding: Does your work and description demonstrate understanding of 3D computer graphics?

For the last two points, I will grade you based on our passed interactions during lab sessions as well as your presentation.
Don't panic if you can't show everything in your presentation (you won't be able to). By now I'm comfortable with what you've been working on, etc.
